# chat_simulation

A small simulation of a chat as a medium to teach myself some concepts about python.

## Purpose
Chat_simulation is designed to create the structure of a semi-natural conversation of a small (and slightly unsocialized) bot that wants to know more about you and your friends. 
Chat_sim is a catbot who is able to recall, conversation attached to a database. 
This script is the first step to eventually starting a small text adventure game project, and will address all of the instances of python for data storage, record updates and 
data manipulation/formatting

# Curriculum
### **ROUND 1** | Create something that works!
`main.py`| Introduction to scrappily creating a functioning script that runs, accepts input and gives output with small manipulations

### **ROUND 2** | Create something that works, with properly formatted functions
`main_0.py` | Recreate a similar instance of main.py (different conversation) with function components outside of the main function.

  - Should have a corresponding `helper.py` 
  - Should have functions that are called through to a main function. 
  - Should have 1 of each: A Strings, a List, An Array, and a Dictionary
      
### **ROUND 3**  | Working with string methods
`main_1.py` | Create a similar instance of main.py (different conversation) that manipulates data using a handful of [string methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp).

  - Doesn't need a helper.py, but can make one if I like to
  - Should have functions that are called through to a `main()` function
  - Should use at least **10 seperate string methods for manipulating input**
  
### **ROUND 4** | Working with string join, and not concatenations üêà
`main_2.py` | Create a similar instance of main.py (different conversation) that doesn't just use string concatinaton, but also using string join.
        - Doesn't need a helper.py, but can make one if I like to
        - Should have functions that are called through to a `main()` function
        
 ### **ROUND 5** | FINAL PROJECT |
 Create a small shop that you are able to ask a shopkeeper a series of items within the shop.
        - Requires a helper.py
        - Uses string joins
        - Should have functions that are called through to a main function. 
        - Should be able to inquire about what exists in the shop, inquire prices, buy items, lowers stock, and sells out.\
        
**Next...** | Recursive pulls, pulling in data from a csv/tsv, and uses numpy


## Updates
### 2020-11-27
- Uploaded to git! First introduction to the code. I've already got some good feedback from some people about how to better handle function calls. 
My initial goal is to create a functioning chatbot, and then go back to create a more optimized formatting for calls.
