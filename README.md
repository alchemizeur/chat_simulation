### What is Good Shopkeeping?

A fantasy CLI game where you navigate through a small world helping various shopkeepers maintain their magic shops. 

## Updates
### 2020-12-14
As you can see, there's been a bit of renaming/rebranding as I've gotten more comfortable with the dynamic of what I want this project to become. Through developing the first few renditions of the madlibs game, I intend for goodshopkeeping to be a good introduction to classes, dynamic variations of storage, and a fun opportunities for those who are seeing this project develop over time. I appreciate any and all help regarding 'good housekeeping' with code, and am well aware that I am going to make mistakes along the way, but I'm very excited to see what I can do. 

I've moved older python files into a `retired` folder where they still can be accessed, but are filed out of the way. I would like to make Good Shopkeeping as neat as possible, as it will be the most complicated thing I've ever written. Hugest shoutouts to  [conorcurry](https://github.com/ConorCurry), [domo929](https://github.com/Domo929) and [robin](https://github.com/weavingmemories) for helping keep my head on straight as I try to figure out the direction of this small fantasy game.
