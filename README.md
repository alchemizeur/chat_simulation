## Purpose
Chat_simulation is designed to create the structure of a semi-natural conversation of a small (and slightly unsocialized) bot that wants to know more about you and your friends. 
Chat_sim is a catbot who is able to recall, conversation attached to a database. 
This script is the first step to eventually starting a small text adventure game project, and will address all of the instances of python for data storage, record updates and 
data manipulation/formatting

## Updates
### 2020-11-27
- Uploaded to git! First introduction to the code. I've already got some good feedback from some people about how to better handle function calls. 
My initial goal is to create a functioning chatbot, and then go back to create a more optimized formatting for calls.
